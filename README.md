## Prerequisites

Install the VSCode [ESP-IDF Extension](https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension)
Install the latest downloadable 'main' [Development Snapshot](https://www.swift.org/install/macos/#development-snapshots) from swift.org to use Embedded Swift. Public releases of Swift do not yet support Embedded Swift.
